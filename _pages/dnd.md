The two campaigns I currently run are co-located on the same planet, roughly eighty years apart from each other.
To follow along with the my parties, you can start reading our campaign and session recaps below.

The Second Age: [The Great and Mighty Grok](/dnd/the-great-and-mighty-grok)

The Third Age: [Imperial Nights](/dnd/imperial-nights)

New chapters will be added as we play, and I'm currently back-filling notes from our earlier games.
