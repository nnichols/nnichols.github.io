So, you finally got that new developer you've been looking for! This is fantastic! You'll be able to chip away at your backlog (which has been growing out of control lately), get a flood of new ideas, and bring your product forward by leaps and bounds!

Well, maybe not right away. After all, they haven't gotten a hang of the ropes yet. Your new developer needs to meet their team, learn about your business, watch those pesky compliance training videos, and figure out how the coffee pot works. That's a breeze, and they should be up and running by the end of the week. Or should it be a month? Longer?

In truth, there is no universal measure for how long your new employees will spend training; however, most of that "dead" time, which I mean as "time not spent coding," tends to show up as a dip in that individual's productive time. It makes sense, and is good to adjust for. That being said, you also need to drop the velocity/WIP limit/etc. for your entire team.

Wait, what?

You heard me right, your team, as a whole unit, will probably suffer a 10-20% drop in efficiency when a new team member joins. This drop can last anywhere from 2-6 weeks or 3-4 months, even though the long term velocity will trend up. Assuming the burden of on-boarding falls squarely on your HR department, the hiring manager, or a mentor is a very common fallacy. The impacts are far more distributed than you may realize.

Training importance, decreasing velocity, etc.
