As promised on the [README](https://github.com/nnichols/nature), nature aims to be "A simple genetic algorithms library for Clojure."

In either case, nature exists, and we can learn from it.
If Genetic Algorithms are new to you, a primer on [evolution mechanics](https://nnichols.github.io/code/nature/evolution-mechanics) is helpful pre-reading.


#### Genetic Algorithm Phases:
1. [Initialization](https://nnichols.github.io/code/nature/initialization)
2. [Fitness Evaluation](https://nnichols.github.io/code/nature/fitness-evaluation)
3. [Selection](https://nnichols.github.io/code/nature/selection)
4. [Reproduction](https://nnichols.github.io/code/nature/reproduction)
5. [Mutation](https://nnichols.github.io/code/nature/mutation)
6. [Generation Advancement and Termination](https://nnichols.github.io/code/nature/termination)
