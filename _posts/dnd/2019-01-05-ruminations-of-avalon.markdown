# The Torch of the Heavens: Nar, Goddess of the Light

- One cannot claim to see light without acknowledging darkness.
- One cannot claim to see good without acknowledging evil.
- To be light is to lose one's root. To be restless is to lose one's control.
- Free of form and free of root, light and fire reach wide
- Light’s reach may comfort the cold or spark ruinous flame
- To master fire and light is to control the uncontrollable
- To master light and fire is to be a humble guide
- The humble guide forfeits all illusion of control
- Light may drive out darkness, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Great White Elk of the Silvermoon Forest: Odo, God of the Living

- All life must come to recognize the haunting guise of death
- The living are no more than the coming dead
- Filling life exceedingly is called ominous. Life must be open
- The living control life as much as the snowflake controls the storm
- Like drops in the ocean, all life is bound as one
- Like grains of sand, all life is cut and divided
- Acting without thought of one’s life is superior to valuing one’s life
- Clamoring for life is like gripping handfuls of mud
- Expecting much of life is to take death lightly, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Guide of Oblivion: Almawt, God of the Dead

- The dead are fortunate, for they were the ones who once had life
- The halls of the dead are filled the echoes of the living
- Those who die without being forgotten get longevity
- Those who would cheat death forfeit life
- Like a great wheel, the end of life is only the beginning of death
- Death lays the bed for all life yet to come
- Acting without thought of one’s death is superior to fearing one’s death
- Those clamoring for death have already died
- Expecting much of death is to take life lightly, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Ever-Reaching Strangleroot: Shú, Goddess of Nature

- Nature is the true balance of life and death
- The felled tree will wither and rot to soil for new life
- All things flourish, and each returns to its source
- The blossoming flower may yield deadly poison
- The ailing root may yield potent medicine
- The woods and bogs are sacred vessels that cannot be changed
- The mountains and valleys are hallowed grounds
- Those who would tamper with nature are not fit to conquer the world.
- In nature we find worldly heavens, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Seer of the Void: Hermaeus, God of Knowledge

- True knowledge is not sought, but found
- Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know
- Those who understand others are clever, those who understand themselves are wise
- Knowledge resides in the minds of others, spread like butter
- Knowledge without wisdom is a fly caught in a web
- Wisdom without knowledge are the dreams of fools
- Those who hoard knowledge tell only secrets and lies
- Secrets and lies are blades sharpened against those that listen
- Secrets are knowledge whispered one to the other, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Eagle of Iron: Nusar, God of War

- War is the destruction of a soul for the creation of a warrior
- War is never the result of true peace
- True peace is never the result of war
- The forceful and violent will not die from natural causes – this is the fate of the warrior
- The learned warrior knows the fortunes of well-timed defeat
- The learned warrior knows the costs of ill-timed victory
- War taunts its soldiers to sacrifice honor for victory
- Those who remains honorable through war find true victory
- War and peace live in great conflict, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Chaser of the Winds: Feng, God of the Tempest

- The clashing of the heavens and the Earth gives birth to the tempest
- Gentle wind may turn wild and uproot the largest tree
- Trickling rain may wear through the thickest stone
- Lightning may clear the forest of ailing and cancerous trees
- Blizzards leave the valleys in serene beauty
- The tempest may quickly settle
- Stillness may be swept away in a moment
- Stillness is the ruler of haste.
- Stillness exists in the eye of the tempest, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Jester of the Nine Hells: Huang, God of Deceit

- True deceit lies within genuine belief
- All understanding is tainted with deceit
- To be free of deceit, one must understand nothing
- The truth is that which cannot be understood
- Those who would hear deceit are tethered
- The tethered must deceive themselves to be free
- True freedom exists without tethers
- Seeking freedom through the truth is a chain to the Earth
- In all lies, some truth may be found, but the two must coexist, each chasing the tail of the other, like koi in a pond

# The Divided Whole: Hiragana, Goddess of Chaos and God of Order

- Chaos has long existed before the Heavens
- Chaos is the state of discord and division
- Chaos comes from those who seek Order
- Order is what all seek and desire
- Order is the state of harmony and unity
- Order comes from those who accept Chaos
- Balance is the way of the ever nameless and the state of the stateless
- Balance is the way of the Heavens, and the Hells,  and  the Earth
- Balance is the way of Hiragana- the true path to enlightenment
