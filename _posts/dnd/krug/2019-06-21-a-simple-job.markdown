With the winter wind at their backs, Krug 'n' Krew follow Arminius east towards a fishing village south of Cadca.
Without horses and a carriage, the journey is much slower, and far less pleasant for those involved.
Tlareg debates leaving the party, but Jack convinces him to stick around until they've cleared themselves.
Most of the journey is uneventful, but on the third day of walking, they see a carriage coming up the road.
Recognizing the ornate design, they immediately dive for cover and silently watch as they drive buy.
Stealing a glance, Jack and Tlareg recognize Gertruda as she stares off into the distance.

Still fearing for their lives, they withhold this information and press onward.
Within the week, they finally arrive to a quaint and picturesque village on the Barovian coast.
With some of the costal breeze, the worst burdens of winter are lifted and everyone appears to be in a better mood.
Krug begins scouting for the largest person he can find, assuming that is a distinct characteristic of those in charge.
Surprisingly enough, this pays off.
A supply boat has been chartered to Elenmar in the Buxswell Dutchie, and if they'll help load the vessel, they can earn passage too.

After a few hours of honest labor, they hit the open seas and begin the long journey north.
Over the next few weeks, Krug attempts to learn how to sail as Jack reads up on the state of the world.
Thaelen, left liquor-less, is forced into a spiritually, emotionally, and physically draining state known as "drying out."
After a few days, the party, unsure what to do with their time, explores the ship and finds a prisoner being transported to **the Harpers.**
Despite his advanced age, the shackled Drow, is surprisingly in-shape and his scars tell of a life's worth of experiences.
He introduces himself as the thief Juib.
Jack asks him about his crimes, and after learning the man was arrested for stealing food for children, leaves a note in his book.

The remainder of the journey passes peacefully, and they eventually find themselves in the port city of Elenmar.
As they disembark, they ask Arminius where they will be headed and what they'll be guarding.
He points towards a large citadel in the center of the town, "First, we must go and speak with the Harpers.
They're organizing the larger mission we'll each be helping with.
Have you heard of them in the past?"

"Not really," Jack replies.

"They are good people, and help those in need.
In this case, we'll be helping the dignitaries and diplomats of nations across Eibellion pay final respects to the dragon **Lysanderoth.**
After more than one thousand years, the protector of our realm will be ending his watch and passing on to the Halls of Order to join Bahamut."
The party contemplates this as they continue to the heart of town; however, not all is grim.
A warm summer breeze and the fresh scents of flowers lifts their spirits.
The protracted hours of darkness and blisteringly cold temperatures had worn Krug 'n' Krew down more than they had anticipated.
While wandering the streets, they take in the sights of normal life: children chasing each other in the streets, craftspeople demonstrating their skills and wares, and the hustle and bustle of civilization.

Now in the center of town, the buildings have shifted from pleasant hillside cottages to dark stone buildings of worship and law.
They press open the massive cathedral doors bearing gilded crests of harps.
The mixed mission of the Harpers is apparent from the interior.
Four shrines dedicated to their core deities adorn four of the six turrets, and the final two house swords, shields, and the common gear adventures would need.
A large, heavy oak table overflowing with maps, reports, and requests is place in the center.
Several knights watch their leader, a short woman with fiery red hair, walks through the most recent orders she has drawn up for the region.

Arminius briefly introduces the party as temporary help for the next few days, and then drags Thaelen to the stations of worship.
Jack, Krug, and Tlareg snicker as their almost zombie-like is yelled at.
The captain, Marie Osterlen, begins to lay out the job our not-so-brave party has been tasked with.

"With such a historic occasion upon us, the Queen has called in as many soldiers as we can properly recruit.
Thankfully, with so much international attention and talent in the area, we're not expecting much excitement.
We're stretching ourselves along the many side roads leading to Whitestone, and the formal army will be watching the main paths.
Your duty is simple.
For the day before through the day after, keep watch and report anything suspicious to us as quickly as possible.
There may be a few locals around, but be on guard for anyone suspicious or armed."

Krug nods along, "What if we find someone?
And they start giving us trouble?
Can we, uh...," while pointing to his halberd.

Jack agrees, "Yeah, we just want to be crystal clear with how in our rights we are to... defend ourselves."

"Certainly you are well within your rights to defend yourselves, but the Harpers aren't in the business of starting fights.
We'd rather prevent them, and, if we cannot achieve that, we end them.
Our continent has known peace for some time, and some of Eibellion's greatest warriors will be paying their respects."

Jack gives the thumbs up, "Got it.
Now, where do we need to be?"

"The path I've chosen for you sits just along the hills to the southeast.
It's about a two days walk, and you're needed there by the end of the week.
We have capacity for you all to rest here, and have enough supplies to outfit you for your time.
When all is said and done, simply return back here and your service will be complete.
If you need anything else, Sir Bertrand will be able to help you."

Thaelen, freshly shown the wonders of religion, returns to the group, and they decide to head out into the town.
