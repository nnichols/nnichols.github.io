Thaelen informs the rest of Krug 'n' Krew that they're not the only party interested in the fate of Barovia.
His compatriots are dismissive of Dalzos's invitation, and focus their thoughts back on the imminent dinner at Castle Ravensloft.
They decide to head back to **Brasov** before the weather turns for the worst.
Feeling exhausted and slowly loosing their concept of time, the party calls it an early night.

The next morning, Thaelen is awoken by the sounds of scratching beneath the floorboards.
In his fast and loose manner, he decides to pull back a few of the floorboards and finds a litter of newborn mice.
After a brief moment of consideration, he ensures that no future infestation will occur through a judicious use of his boot.
He drags himself downstairs, shows the bartender his bloodied boot, and asks if he can get paid for his services.
Disgusted, the dwarf agrees, and throws Thaelen at least two days worth of drinking money- if he'll clean his boots before wandering around the bar any more.

As Thaelen completes the task, the rest of the party agrees that their collective coffers are running dry.
For the remainder of the day, the party completes several odd jobs around town- repairing an old shed, clearing a few walkways of snow, and helping hauls goods into a store.
In return, they manage to recoup the costs of their travels and then some.

Eventually, they all return to their home base, and decide to spend an evening sober in preparation of their big day.
Unfortunately, they are not granted restful sleep.
Howling gales of wind send shutters crashing against the windows.
Strange lights in the distance plague Krug and Jack with feared memories of their meeting with Cortessio.
Warped dreams and nightmares disrupt those who manage to shut their eyes.

The group sleeps late into the morning.
A few hours behind what they had intended, the rush back to **Edderson's Clothiers** to retrieve their order.
As they approach, they see the elf watch them from between the blinds.
He slams the door open, shoves their orders in their hands, and begins hurrying back into his business.
Thaelen, suspicious of all who breathe, shouts, "Hey hey hey hey hey, we gotta check and make sure we got everything first."

The elf shouts over his shoulder, "I've made sure that you do so your visit may be as short as possible."
Satisfied with the answer, the party rushes back to begin preparing for the evening.
They take turns bathing and getting dressed, and ensure Bemril's attire is suitable for a servant as well.
Dressed to the nines, the party climbs back in their cart and head towards their dinner.

The road lead out of town and winds up the soft face of the hill upon which Castle Ravensloft stands.
As they approach the outer gate, it swings open and Krug 'n' Krew see the parked carts of their fellow dinner guests.
A few servants rush out to help Bemril tie up the animals and offer him a chance to stay in their quarters until dinner has finished.
One of Strahd's assistants personally takes the portrait back to the castle to inspect.
The rest of the party is reacquainted with the elderly gnome that had granted them this audience.
He rushes them indoors and leads them down a lavish corridor of marble and at the rear of the line of guests for that evening's celebration.

The booming voice of one of Strahd's aides rings through the castle, "Now announcing the Lord and Lady Mazyr and Elma Kovel."

There is a moment of silence before the next guest is called, "Master of the Hunt Dorek Tuzla followed by the Lady Zoya Szolnok."

"Now seating The Lord and Lady Andrei and Nadia Lauciene."

The party now stands at the door of Strahd's dining room.
A long, elegant ebony table is beautifully decorated with fine linens, pristine silverware, and flickering candles.
The walls a filled with deep violet drapes spaced between paintings of the former lords and ladies of the land.
A large fireplace crackles behind the tall, vacant seat at the head of the table.

In an uncharacteristically loud voice, the gnome calls out, "The distinguished guests of honor: Tlareg, Krug, Misha, Six, Thaelen Melrose, and Jack Skelet."
The party enters to smiles and nods to their accomplishment, and stand ready to be seated in the center seats on either side of the table.
A moment of refined silence passes before the gnome calls out for one final time, "Finally, our sovereign lord: Count Adrianus Vladimir Tepes Enderson Strahd."
