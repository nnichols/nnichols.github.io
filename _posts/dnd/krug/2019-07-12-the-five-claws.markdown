description: "Having survived the attack on Whitestone, Krug 'n' Krew look to solve new riddles."
---

Krug 'n' Krew, along with several of the other able-bodied Harpers spend a few hours dealing with the immediate fallout of the attack: tending to the wounded, reuniting families, and distributing supplies.
Later in the day, once the immediate are is secure, they begin investigating for any clues that may lead to the attackers whereabouts.
Thaelen begins slowly casting _Detect Magic_ as his compatriots, aided by a few of those remaining, scan the grounds.
Krug and a muscle bound dwarf begin eyeing each other and flexing, Jack struggles to overturn the debris and over-exerts himself, and Tlareg pokes around several of the corpses looking for survivors.
As Thaelen begins to see the ebb and flow of the Fold, he notices a speck of familiar energy not too far away.
One of the volunteers, a young halfling woman, is poking around the epicenter of the attack.
Sensing the powers of his own mystic school, Evocation, he approaches her.

"Hey, friend.
I'm sensing something pretty dangerous around here, have you found anything?"

"Maybe.
What's it to ya?"

Clegane / Birdie

Marie Osterlen and Arminius Wintergale explain the attack on Whitestone with the details they know:
1) Five masked men, like the ones KnK already encountered announced their presence after Lysanderoth's final speech.
2) As the body was being moved to be interred, the Red Mask scattered a __Necklace of Fireballs__ across the attendants vaporizing itself, destroying guard stations, and causing the ensuing chaos
3) The city is now overflowing with refugees, and Aramir is denying rights of exit until an investigation can be completed
4) Citizens are refugees, foreign dignitaries are retreating within their escorts, and all armed forces are on edge
5) The group will need to help find those responsible,

Thaelen will recognize the shimmerweave worn by the cultists from his time in the Idravalli Empire. (Sharn)

From there, the party will choose how to investigate:
- Marie believes the Harpers work is thorough, and will assume the device must have been locally sourced much earlier. She will point them to the arcane expert Ioctal with the last remaining bead to learn more
- Arminius assumes the work to be done by the Five Claws, a group of Tiamat cultists. He will point the group to the cleric Patron Ytraz to learn what rituals may be planned.
- Guards and locals will blame a local syndicate known as Nightshade. They will point the party to Pebrem's Row, the seedier part of town.

Ioctal: (The Ivory Tower - District of the Lords) [concentric rings decorating ceiling - Well of Guf]
- The necklace was definitely imported, implying connections to a criminal element, and knows Nightshade has dealt in exotic magical items once before.
- Dragon scales are known components in powerful rituals. He still doesn't fully understand religious magics, and will point to Patron Ytraz as well
- Shimmerweave is a unique fabric from Toramand
- Given the shoddy construction of the materials, he knows they could not have been teleported through the Lyceum

Ytraz: (Temple of the Platinum Dragon - District of the Heavens) [Catholic church]
- Rumors of Tiamat worshippers have become common, as have dissidents against the new gods. There are rabble rousers in Pebrem's Row
- Shimmerweave and the necklace are undeniably arcane constructs, something Ioctal would know about
- Destroying the metallic dragons, especially the Guardians of the Ages, is a long-standing goal of Tiamat. With Lysanderoth gone, it will be some time before the next element and next Guardian are known

Pebrem's Row: (District of the Commons)
- Refugees are flooding the streets, looking for shelter, and many less-than-favorable "businesses" are springing up to meet demand. They fear and ignore foreign military forces
- A fence, Eothan Millard (Halfling) will try to set the group up with rooms, booze, etc. He'll also hint at magical wares for discerning customers
  - His tavern, The Ghoulish Mare, is a hotbed for lowlifes
  - If "persuaded" he recognizes the necklace as a special order he took. They paid extra for delivery and anonymity, but after the explosion he's willing to give up the location for immunity  
    - Their base of operations is the Jaded Knoll, a cave to the west of Whitestone
  - He had no interest in their business, just their money.
  - The proceeds were used to settle the opposing claims to his bar.

Jaded Knoll - Steal Lost Mines of Phandelver dungeon, swap Kobolds in, add boss: 1 Warlock, 1 Wizard, and 1 Druid (Ritual platform like that in Sharn)
Found Treasure: 1500 copper, 500 silver, and 50 gold
                +1 dagger
                Immovable Rod

Reward Hooks: Gratitude from Queen Aramir of Wighland, An offer to permanently join the Harpers, Work in Abberion
