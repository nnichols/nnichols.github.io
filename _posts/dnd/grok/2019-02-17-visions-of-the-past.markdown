As Sif catches his breath, he quickly contemplates his two options: running to safety and pressing onward.
As he looks over the scattered furniture, the cleric realizes that anyone else in the lair has probably been alerted.
He swallows the lump in his throat, and continues through the unopened door in the dining hall.
To little surprise, he sees a man in black robes wielding a dagger heading in his direction.
Through sheer instinct, Sif casts _Sacred Flame_ and scorches the necromancer in purifying flame.

The greasy, unkempt human charges forward landing a blow with a poisoned dagger.
Sif's vision begins to blur, and his wild blows with Estelle only find the stone wall.
They continue to trade blows and spells until both are bloodied pulps.
The necromancer attempts to siphon some of the cleric's life energy, but the spell doesn't seem to have any effect.
Stealing his moment, Sif manifests another _Sacred Flame_ and puts an end to the haunting of Gadriel's mine.

Sif collapses against the wall, and catches his breath for the next few minutes.
Having taken his powers to their full extent, he knows he'll be unable to tend to his wounds magically.
Accepting this, he begins tiptoeing about the rest of the room.
He quickly grabs a few of the necromancer's books, hoping to learn more, as well as a small pouch of coins.
Sif begins creeping along the wall, trying to remain as silent as possible as he works his way back to safety.
His head pounds with drunkenness and blood loss.

Retracing his steps, he sneaks back to the long entrance corridor and notices two additional rooms along the way.
He stops at each of the doors to check for new threats.
The first contains a small ritual circle whose purpose is unknown to Sif.
The second is a library, that, while interesting to the cleric, is less enticing than the thought of survival.
He quickly scrambles out, and hurries back to camp.
The two guards see Sif in his injured state and hurry him off to a makeshift medical tent.
Before passing out, he mutters, "It's all good there now."

After a well-deserved rest, Sif awakens and properly tends to his wounds- chief among them a hangover.
As he sits in bed, he recounts the events of the night prior and remembers passing out.
Instinctively, he pats down on Estelle and feels some slight sense of comfort; however, he is still unsettled by whatever vision or nightmare had taken his consciousness.
Sif decides to keep this to himself, and reports back to Gadriel.
The elf thanks Sif for his aide, but is worried about the ritual circle.
Cautious of the danger it presents, he asks Sif to find an arcane adept to help dispel whatever effect it may have.

Sif, unfamiliar with magic outside of the domain of the religious, asks where he could find such a person.
Thankfully, Gadriel knows of a library in the massive city of Ishtar that would draw curious minds from across the continent.
He pays Sif for the work he has finished, and promises a bonus for the new job.
Eager for anything gold and shiny, the cleric agrees.

Thankfully, Aelith had marked Ishtar on the map he sold Sif with two points of interest: The Hightower of Nusar, and the Monastery of Avalon.
Remembering Wu Shen, the monk that had attacked the bandits at Cirrus, he writes a note to visit the monastery.
Sif collects his things and packs up for the journey north.
He is able to hitch a ride with a travelling family, and make the trip in just under two days.

As they cut into the arid grasslands of the continent's heart, Sif parts ways with his travelling companions.
Ahead of him, he sees a sight that confirms he has reached his destination: the Wandering Market.
For nearly a mile leading up to the city's walls, various merchants, travelers, con-people, and artists have set up small, temporary stalls and shops.
Feeling the coins rattle about in his purse, he decides to do some shopping.

He wanders through the sea of wandering souls until he happens to find a tall, dark-skinned, gorgeous man with long, flowing locks.
Mildly enamored, Sif approaches him and asks to see his goods.
The human, introducing himself as Shaun Gilmore, regales Sif with some stories of his own adventures and offerings of magical wares.
Sif quickly realizes he is out of his league, but decides to treat himself to a simple bow and a newer shield.
Thanking Gilmore, he promises to spread the word of the shop the wizard owns in Ishtar: Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
