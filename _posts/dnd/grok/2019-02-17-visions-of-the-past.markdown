As Sif catches his breath, he quickly contemplates his two options: running to safety and pressing onward.
As he looks over the scattered furniture, the cleric realizes that anyone else in the lair has probably been alerted.
He swallows the lump in his throat, and continues through the unopened door in the dining hall.
To little surprise, he sees a man in black robes wielding a dagger heading in his direction.
Through sheer instinct, Sif casts _Sacred Flame_ and scorches the necromancer in purifying flame.

The greasy, unkempt human charges forward landing a blow with a poisoned dagger.
Sif's vision begins to blur, and his wild blows with Estelle only find the stone wall.
They continue to trade blows and spells until both are bloodied pulps.
The necromancer attempts to siphon some of the cleric's life energy, but the spell doesn't seem to have any effect.
Stealing his moment, Sif manifests another _Sacred Flame_ and puts an end to the haunting of the mine.
