1) Don't be a dick.
   I shouldn't have to elaborate more.

2) The Metagaming Pigeon is always watching

3) Drinking a potion is a Bonus Action.
   Force Feeding a potion is a full action.

4) Take good notes.
   If you need a hail mary memory spark, you can try one as a Wisdom Saving Throw; however, the DC ramps quickly.

5) The first resurrection/revivify/etc. automatically succeeds (barring any ruling from the DMG/PHB).
   After that, it becomes a group skill challenge, and the DC ramps quickly.

6) Once you fall beneath 0 hp, keep track of damage into the negatives.
   To regain consciousness, you must heal back above 0 hp.
   You may still be stabilized, but this does not bring you back to consciousness.
   If you ever take your full hp in the negatives, you die.

7) Currently legal player options: Player's Handbook, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, Volo's Guide to Monsters, Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide, Eibellion Campaign Setting Guide (Anything on my website or DM's Guild page).
   If you want to play something outside of these options, work with Brainlessmunkey

8) If you miss 3 consecutive sessions (barring extreme exceptions), your character will be dead.
