### Synopsis

Almawt is both feared and respected across the continent of Ivalion, and his worship is entrenched in a similar duality.
For many, especially those that call Blackrock Heights their home, death is the decision of Almawt alone.
The act of killing is the most grievous sin.
To others, death is worthy of celebration and praise.
Many warriors and champions praise the daily selections Almawt must make.
In both schools of thought, visiting the god’s domain atop Blackrock Heights is a common, once-in-a-lifetime journey.
Some spend their entire lives saving enough money to be able to die in the god’s presence.

Almawt appears on the Material Plane under the guise of an ancient human man with weathered skin, slowly walking across the continent with a plain staff of bristlecone pine.
He is ominously silent, only gesturing the few times he communicates with mortals.
The acolytes of Death believe the god also communicates through omen, and often carry sets of tarot cards, animal bones, and tea leaves to divine his will.
Blackrock Heights, and the Bottomless Crypts, are the god’s primary residence.
Miles upon miles of catacombs branch off in every direction, all connected through a vast central pit with no apparent end.
Those who have tried to find the crypt’s bottom have all mysteriously vanished, and some believe that it hides the god’s private sanctum- a place no living being can enter.

Almat’s holy day is fittingly the last day of the last month- the dying of the year.
Celebrations of this occasion are as varied as individual perspectives of death.
In the Empire of the First Sun, it is often a quiet day of reflection.
In the Eternal Horde, the dead are celebrated with feasts and music.
The Kingdom of the Red Lion falls somewhere in between, with long, traditional ceremonies that mourn the dead but celebrate the time we have left in this world.
