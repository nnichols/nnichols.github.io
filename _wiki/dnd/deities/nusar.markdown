### Synopsis

As a land embroiled in endless conflict, Nusar serves as one of the most controversial icons in the Pantheon of Eibellion.
Many believe worship of the Eagle of Iron has only drawn out the centuries-long conflict, and the worshipers of Nusar agree.
The countless soldiers seeking glory, power, and their place amongst the heroes have found ample opportunity to prove their might, and there is no end to the chaos on the horizon; however, it is not mindless bloodshed.
The Disciples of War seek greater and greater challenges and meet them fairly.
Should you find yourself toe-to-toe with a zealot of the faith, know that you will be armed, and know that they will be unrelenting.

There is no shortage of statues, painting, and icons honoring Nusar, and very little artistic license is taken with his form.
His feathers take the form of blades, his eyes are red with blood, and his talons stretch forth to find their next victim.
In other works, the icon of the axe is used to denote the worship of war- as simple and viscous as the deity himself.

Nusar’s realm, known as Fossdusang, is a grand arena occupying one of the Nine Hells.
It is a vast, grand coliseum where the titans of the realms meet in combat.
For those lucky enough to watch the blood sport, endless flagons of ale, wine, and whiskey accompany meals fit for warrior-kings.

The faith’s holy day is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month, and is as raucous as the rest of god’s worship.
Celebrations begin early and often carry over into the wee hours of the next day- and sometimes the day after.
Wrestling matches, eating and drinking competitions, and other feats of glory and strength are seldom interrupted by the quieter rituals common to other faiths.

### Pre-History

As one of the original eight deities of Eibellion, Nusar came into existence during the Sundering of Mount Propius.
He emerged from the Fold as the fourth daemon, following [Huang](/dnd/wiki/deities/huang), [Hermaeus](/dnd/wiki/deities/hermaeus), and [Feng](/dnd/wiki/deities/feng); making him the antithetical deity to [Almawt](/dnd/wiki/deities/almawt).
Unlike the other daemons, Nusar spent most of transitory time leading up to the dawn of civilization within the Nine Hells.
During these eons, he broke countless demon clans and bent them to his eternal service while constructing Fossdusang.

### The First Age

For most of the First Age, Nusar remained within the Nine Hells and forced his endless legions to battle each other for his amusement.
The conflicts served a second purpose, as the god desired to find warriors powerful enough for his service.
Strong clans began to emerge, but Nusar was still disappointed by the inherit flaw his armies possessed: a weakness to the radiant energies of the angels and gods.
For this reason, Nusar's gaze fell upon the mortal races.
Their limited lives made them impulsive and yearning for meaning.
The promise of glory and honor was simple, but effective.

Relative peace and prosperity had fallen over Ilswyrr and Ushazan, but the harsh climates in the far reaches of Ivalion and Abberion bred the resource constraints that led to conflict.
The fight to survive was quickly warped into a bloodlust, and roaming bands of worshippers began to emerge.
As the Dark Ascendant's undead armies began to spread across the continent, many of Nusar's worshippers began to willingly join the unholy conquest.
Imbued with an insatiable appetite for destruction, they burned their way across the continent with deadly efficiency.
As the angels began to intervene, Nusar's daemonic legions rose to answer the new threat.
At this point, the Dark Ascendant's rise erupted into the multi-planar conflict known as the War of the Gods.

During the conflict, many mortals found their way to Fossdusang, hoping to prove their might to Nusar in exchange for favors.
One of the few to succeed in this venture was Avalon.
The monk's mastery of the three original monastic fighting styles impressed Nusar, as did his willingness to fight the fledgling deity Orcus.
However, this would ultimately backfire.
With Avalon's aide, Nar was able to erect the Great Barrier, confining Nusar to the Nine Hells.

### The Second Age

Nusar's confinement only increased the cruelty and intensity of Fossdusang's bloodsport.
Even with his near-limitless power, the god was only able to force a minuscule fraction of his will and rage to the Prime Material Plane.
Ultimately, this energy was enough to sustain an order of clerics and paladins scattered across Eibellion.
Seeing his forces divided, Nusar stripped most of his followers of their gifts and consolidated them within the fledgling tribes that would comprise The Eternal Horde.
Their soldiers faced brutal conditions, harsh wildlife, and the constant threat of The Kingdom of the Red Lion and the Empire of the First Sun.
As these skirmishes erupted into the Ivalion Conflict, his worshippers and fanatics swelled in numbers.

The conflict stalled out and drug on for several centuries until one of the god's clerics stumbled upon Grok- a barbarian responsible for saving the artifact known as the Amulet of Iron.
While the half-orc seemed unexceptional at first, the cleric believe he met the criteria of an ancient prophecy of Nusar's next champion.
To this end, Grok, Sif, Jack Prostyson, and Barommakat Ivanova were sent into the Underdark beneath Kraghammer to fight Damhan'Alla.
Having proved successful, the party was then tested against the spellscarred dragon Mykryd and the Sisters of the Silvermoon Forest.
While in Sharendar, Grok ended up facing Lord Ravenscroft and routing the Razor Fang druids.

Unbeknownst to Grok, the conflict had prevented a yearly ritual designed to reinforce the Great Barrier.
Ravenscroft, sensing a larger plot, marched his soldiers against the Hightower of Nusar and blinded the cleric responsible.
Nusar decided to reward this servant, and bestowed the title of Highseer for the first time since the First Age.
Feeling his restraints weakening, Nusar began organizing his acolytes on Eibellion.
The cracks in the barrier renewed his strength, and also opened a means of contact with Ras.
The rakshasa had found a means of freedom in the remnants of Vecna's soul.

To this end, Hokulk was granted a vision to rediscover Grok with the aide of Torryn Scaleslayer.
Months later, the paladin returned victorious.
Nusar flooded his three acolytes with strength, and, at the cost of the Highseer's life, revealed the Titan Stone embedded within the Amulet of Iron.
The weapon, along with Vecna's knowledge and Ras's bloodseal, ultimately proved enough to shatter the Great Barrier.

Free to roam the planes again, Nusar returned to his great infinite conquest.
As a reward to his faithful soldiers, Hokulk, Yasada, and Grok were granted titles as well as a single feather from the Eagle of Iron.

### The Third Age

With the Great Barrier destroyed, Nusar's armies were once again free to roam the Ten Realms.
Daemonic raids continue to spread and clash with any and all opponents they can find; however, there is one target valued above the others.
The Divine Gate, and the vigilant watch of the Anathema, are the sole deterrent keeping the War God from invading Eibellion directly.
For this reason, the Idravalli Empire is a hotbed for daemonic activity.
The constant threat eventually necessitated the creation of the Ordo Inquisitas, and played a major role in their devolution to paranoia and brutality.

### Trivia

- "Fossdusang" is a cross-language pun that roughly translates to "Waterfall of Blood."
  "Foss du" is the literal Norwegian translation for "waterfall".
  "Du sang" is French for "some blood."
- Nusar has no sworn enemies, as he believes *all* beings must endure the crucible of combat- even gods.
