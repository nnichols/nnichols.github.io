### Synopsis

As a land embroiled in endless conflict, Nusar serves as one of the most controversial icons in the Pantheon of Eibellion.
Many believe worship of the Eagle of Iron has only drawn out the centuries-long conflict, and the worshipers of Nusar agree.
The countless soldiers seeking glory, power, and their place amongst the heroes have found ample opportunity to prove their might, and there is no end to the chaos on the horizon; however, it is not mindless bloodshed.
The Disciples of War seek greater and greater challenges and meet them fairly.
Should you find yourself toe-to-toe with a zealot of the faith, know that you will be armed, and know that they will be unrelenting.

There is no shortage of statues, painting, and icons honoring Nusar, and very little artistic license is taken with his form.
His feathers take the form of blades, his eyes are red with blood, and his talons stretch forth to find their next victim.
In other works, the icon of the axe is used to denote the worship of war- as simple and viscous as the deity himself.

Nusar’s realm, known as Fossdusang, is a grand arena occupying one of the Nine Hells.
It is a vast, grand coliseum where the titans of the realms meet in combat.
For those lucky enough to watch the blood sport, endless flagons of ale, wine, and whiskey accompany meals fit for warrior-kings.

The faith’s holy day is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month, and is as raucous as the rest of god’s worship.
Celebrations begin early and often carry over into the wee hours of the next day- and sometimes the day after.
Wrestling matches, eating and drinking competitions, and other feats of glory and strength are seldom interrupted by the quieter rituals common to other faiths.
