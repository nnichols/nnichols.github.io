### Synopsis

Religion is a universal and hotly debated aspect of all cultures.
No single god is universally worshipped, but all find some semblance of an organized following.
As is always the case, worship is equally complicated.
Many find peace in organized churches, while other prefer their relationships with the gods to be an entirely personal affair.
While the means of devotion are wide and unique to individuals and nations, knowledge about gods is much more neatly organized.
The gods and daemons of Eibellion are living, breathing entities, and their wills are known to mortals.

### Commonalities

In general, all deities, wether gods or daemons, share these common traits:

1. Immortality, and immunity from aging and disease
2. A reliance upon worship for power
3. A deep connection to the Fold
4. A means of bestowing and revoking power to their followers

Beyond this, each divine entity's power, realm, and appearance differs wildly.
And what an individual calls a god will depend upon their tribe.
Many of the following discussion points and divisions are drawn between deities.

#### Gods and Daemons

Even the colloquial status of a god or a daemon isn't universally agreed upon.
Some claim that it is a connection the the High Heavens or the Nine Hells, and others believe it to be a matter of perspective.
The emergence of deities bound to the Four Elemental Planes complicated this discussion further.
For example, Thordak and his destructive reign over the Plane of Fire often earns him the title of Daemon;
however, the dragon has no true connection to the Nine Hells, aside from a shared philosophy.
Some prefer to examine the contract between deity and worshipper, assuming benevolence to be associated with gods, and forced service an attribute of daemons.
This argument often breaks down when examining the harsh, strict commandments within Heaven's Gate and more militaristic traditions.

#### Prime versus Ascendant
