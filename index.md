Hi! My name is Nick Nichols. I'm a clojure-centric developer currently focused on web-facing projects. In my spare time, I'm a dungeon master and publish modules, rule extensions, and the lore of my game world, Eibellion, when possible.

The two campaigns I currently run are co-located on the same planet, roughly eighty years apart from each other. To follow along with the my parties, you can start reading our campaign and session recaps below.

The Second Age: [The Great and Mighty Grok](https://nnichols.github.io/alcoholic-amnesiac)

The Third Age: [Imperial Nights](https://nnichols.github.io/where-all-roads-lead/)

New chapters will be added as we play, and I'm currently back-filling notes from our earlier games.

Thanks!
